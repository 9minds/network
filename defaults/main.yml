# The user can explicitly set host variables "network_provider",
# "network_service_name" and "network_packages".
#
# Usually, the user only wants to select the "network_provider"
# (or not set it at all and let it be autodetected via the
# internal variable "{{ network_provider_default }}". Hence,
# depending on the "network_provider", a different set of
# service-name and packages is chosen.
#
# That is done via the internal "_network_provider_setup" dictionary.
# If the user doesn't explicitly set "network_service_name" or
# "network_packages" (which he usually wouldn't), then the defaults
# from "network_service_name_default_*" and "network_packages_default_*"
# apply. These values are hard-coded in this file, but they also could
# be overwritten as host variables or via vars/*.yml.
