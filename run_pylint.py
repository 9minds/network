Usage: python run_pylint.py ARGUMENTS

Run pylint with ARGUMENTS followed by the list of python files contained in the
working directory and its subdirectories.  As a python file is recognized a
file that match the regular expression .*\\.py[iw]?$.  Files and directories
that match the regular expression ^\\..* are skipped.  Symbolic links are also
skipped.

There are several cases when argument from ARGUMENTS is not passed to pylint
but it is handled by run_pylint.py instead:

  1. if -h or --help is contained in ARGUMENTS, this help screen is printed to
     the standard output and run_pylint.py exits with 0;
  2. if --include followed by a PATTERN is contained in ARGUMENTS, the PATTERN
     is used to recognize whether the file is a python file or not, instead of
     default .*\\.py[iw]?$;
  3. if --exclude followed by a PATTERN is contained in ARGUMENTS, the PATTERN
     is used to recognize whether the file or directory should be skipped (i.e.
     instead of default ^\\..*, the PATTERN is used).

Exclusion takes a priority over inclusion, i.e. if a file or directory can be
both included and excluded, it is excluded.
